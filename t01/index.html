            <td>The Soul Stone ranks as possibly the most
      dangerous of all the Infinity Stones, with it
      holding a special standing among
      others. The sacrifices for the Stone are
      permanent and irreversible, as not even the
      omnipotent combination of the Six Stones
      could resurrect them. The Soul Stone has
      the ability to manipulate the soul, the
      essence that makes up an individual, and
      has the ability to resurrect and conjure the
      spiritual representation of the people who
      are dead.</td>

            <td>As the Infinity Stone that represents,
      describes and governs over the flow of time,
      the Time Stone is among the most powerful
      artifacts in all existence. Due to its power, it
      cannot be held and used by anyone not
      powerful enough to withstand it, thus forcing
      Agamotto to create the Eye of Agamotto as
      a container to allow other sufficiently
      advanced sorcerers to wield it.</td>

            <td>As the Infinity Stone that represents and
      governs over space, the Space Stone
      grants the wielder absolute control over
      space itself. It is primarily used to open
      portals to other locations and can even
      allow interdimensional travel. As one of the
      six Infinity Stones, the Space Stone ranks
      as among the most powerful artifacts in the
      universe, with Black Widow saying it has the
      power to wipe out an entire planet.</td>

      governs the fabric of mind, the Mind Stone
      grants whoever holds it complete control
      over the hearts and minds of others. Like
      with all the other Infinity Stones, it is among
      the most powerful artifacts in all existence.</td>

            <td>As the Infinity Stone that represented and
      governs over reality, the Reality Stone
      granted its user absolute control over reality
      itself. However, like all other Infinity Stones,
      due to it being the most powerful artifact in
      existence, it can only be wielded by beings
      of sufficient power and inside beings of no
      powers, it will inevitably kill them, as
      evidenced with Jane Foster.</td>

        sustaining and destructive forces of the
        universe, the Power Stone grants its wielder
        tremendous energy manipulation
        capabilities. Due to the amount of energy
        the Power Stone releases, it is the most
        destructive out of all the Infinity Stones in
        terms of raw power.</td>
