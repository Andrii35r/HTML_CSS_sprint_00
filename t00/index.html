      <h1 id="Sup">What makes a superheroes?</h1>
      <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a
normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero,<b>you need a power that is more
  exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,</b> and you need to use
that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered
a superhero.
        <br>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story
or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it
becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being
couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
